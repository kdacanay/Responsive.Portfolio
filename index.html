                             <p> People keep saying that this bootcamp will probably be one of the most challenging things I have ever done.</p>
                    
                            <p> And I am here to tell you, that it is 100% true.</p>
            
                            <p> I never saw myself as a computer progammer, or wanting to do anything with computers.  Ever.  Seriously.  I can barely read the calender app 
                                    on my Iphone. I loved those days where I played "Snake" on my Nokia, burning a mix cd for a friend, or had an actual conversation with people in front of you. 
                                    I am the worst when it comes to technology.</p>
                    
                            <p> But I've always been a good learner.  So I find myself in this class (a 30-something guy who went to three different art schools and took him a decade to get his associate's degree)
                                    constantly thinking about computers, and coding, and wanting to see this bootcamp through.</p>
                    
                            <p>I've spent years playing in bands, writing songs, playing shows, painting and drawing, hating and loving and hating again everything I ever created.  Now I find myself
                                    completely passionate about something that has never crossed my mind before.</p>
                        
                            <p>So yes, it is one of the most challenging things I ever done, and I'm loving every minute.</p>
