                        <p> My name is Ken Dacanay, and I am a second-generation Filipino, and the youngest of four
                                boys. My wife Jen
                                and I have just celebrated our 10th anniversary, and, have just welcomed our first child
                                into the world, Liliana Elise. </p>
                        <p>I never really know what to write when you are asked to describe yourself. I think the first
                                few sentences were okay, but do they
                                really identify who I am? Of course not. I've been to so many schools, attempting to
                                achieve a degree that would maybe help define me and give me my
                                purpose, but I never truly loved any direction I went, I just went for the easiest,
                                common route. I figured if I was good at it, I would like it and eventually
                                love it. </p>
                        <p>I do identify myself as a musician, maybe an artist, but definitely a songwriter. But a
                                computer coder? A web developer? Ten years ago, if you told me I would
                                be in a computer coding boot camp from Penn University, I would have laughed. I barely
                                know how to use an Ipod let alone my Iphone, and never knew the difference between
                                a Mac and a PC until like, five years ago. But, it's funny how life works. You never
                                know what's around the corner. </p>
                        <p>I got sick a few years ago and am now on social security benefits, but I also became a newly
                                wide-eyed dad, and now found myself falling in love, for the first time,
                                the direction I am now on: becoming a web developer. </p>
